Small perl script that will look for files in a queue directory and run a
shell command against them. Should the shell command fail the command will
be retried periodically. Should the command succeeed the file will be
deleted from the spool directory.

The script is not persistent in memory hence has to be executed
periodically, e.g. from cron every minute

* * * * * /path/to/retry-command.pl --cmd "scp {} myserver:" --spooldir /path/to/spooldir

When you drop new files in the spooldir and next execute the script the it
will attempt to run the command against those files; in this case attempting
to 'scp' it to 'myserver'. Should the scp succeed (returns shell exit
status 0) the file will be deleted from spooldir, if it fails it will enter
a retry strategy, bydefault retrying after 1 hour.  The script achieves this
retry by renaming the files prepending the next retry time to the filename
e.g. "myfile" becomes "myfile-retry20170726000000", ensuring the script
ignores the file until after 2017-07-26 01:00:00, 1 hour after the current
time.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the arguments

./retry-command.pl [--help|-h] --cmd|-c [--retry|-r <secs>] --spooldir|-s <dir>
  -h --help           display this help content
  -c --cmd  <cmd>     execute this command on queue contents: substitute {} for filename from spool directory
  -r --retry <secs>   retry failed commands every <secs> (default 3600)
  -s --spooldir <dir> pick up work from this directory (e.g. work queue)
